# Videogame
Multiplatform game engine

*"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." - Leonardo da Vinci*

Videogame is the powerhouse used by [Magato Entertainment](http://cutt.ly/maragato) titles, among others.

## Concept
Games are made of Scene objects, which contain Sprite objects. The engine needs at least one initial Scene object to be initialized.

## Usage
Please refer to the [skel](/skel) for a kick-start. Click [here](https://diogoeichert.github.io/videogame/skel/) to see it running. Then refer to [videogame.js](videogame.js) and [plugins.js](plugin.js) sources to see what the API is capable of.

## Support
Please consider joining the [discussions](https://github.com/diogoeichert/videogame/discussions) for collaboration and support.
