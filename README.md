# core2d
Multiplatform 2D interaction engine

*"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler". - Albert Einstein*

Core2D is the powerhouse used by [Maragato マラガト](https://maragato.itch.io) titles, among others.

## Concept
Apps created with Core2D are made of one or more scenes, which may contain one or more sprites. That's it.

## Features
- collision detection: translated to events, to keep update logic clean;
- image cache: assets and their transformations are reused automatically;
- user input: human interaction is abstracted via controllers and pointers;
- virtual resolution: internal geometry frees the app logic from displays.

## Installing
### Node.js
```
npm install core2d
```

## Usage
- try the [skel](https://diogoeichert.github.io/core2d/skel) app for a kick-start;
- refer to the [source code](src/) to see what the API is capable of.
