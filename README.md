Multiplatform game engine

*"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." - Leonardo da Vinci*

Videogame is the powerhouse used by [Magato Entertainment](http://cutt.ly/maragato) titles, among others.

## Concept
Games are made of Scene objects, which contain Sprite objects. The engine needs at least one initial Scene object to be initialized.

## Installing
### Node.js
```
npm install videogame
```
### Web
